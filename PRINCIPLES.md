# PRINCIPALS

## The Three Shared Principles of ALLOCATE

These apply equally to Allocate Energy and Allocate Capital.

**1. Reality First**

Allocation begins with what exists, not what is promised.

All allocation is grounded in measurable reality - energy, time, hardware, or capital that is already present or verifiably committed. No claims are made on resources that do not yet exist.

Reality is the starting point, not an assumption.


---

**2. Choice Under Constraint**

Allocation is the act of choosing between constrained options.

Every allocation decision is made under limits imposed by physics, time, or availability of capital. There is no neutral option and no free allocation. Not choosing is itself a choice.

Freedom exists inside constraints, not outside them.


---

**3. Consequences Are Explicit**

Allocation always produces outcomes, costs, and trade-offs.

Every allocation carries opportunity cost and irreversible effects. These consequences are made visible before allocation occurs and measured after it does.

Allocation without consequences is accounting fiction.

##Allocate Energy - Three Principles

### E1. Energy Is Local

Energy is harvested, stored, and consumed locally.

Energy does not move freely across space or time. Each node operates autonomously, constrained by local generation, storage, and demand.

Bitcoin may coordinate value globally, but energy remains physical and local.


---

### E2. Allocation Precedes Use

Energy must be allocated before it is consumed, stored, or transformed.

Every unit of harvested energy is explicitly assigned to a purpose: immediate use, delayed use, or conversion to opportunity value. Waste is an allocation failure, not a necessity.


---

### E3. Measurement Is the System

If it cannot be measured, it cannot be allocated.

Energy flows, storage state, load behavior, and outputs are continuously measured in SI units. Measurement is not a reporting layer — it is the control layer.


---

##Allocate Capital - Three Principles

### C1. Capital Enables Capacity

Capital exists to create or expand physical and operational capacity.

Capital allocation does not seek abstraction or leverage. It is used to add panels, batteries, nodes, loads, and monitoring — things that exist and decay in the real world.

Capital that does not change capacity is inert.


---

### C2. Allocation Is Not a Promise

Capital allocation does not guarantee returns.

Allocating capital grants exposure to outcomes, not entitlement to results. Returns, if any, emerge from system performance under real constraints.

This is allocation, not obligation.


---

### C3. Time Is the Cost of Capital

Capital allocation unfolds over time and decays through use.

Hardware degrades, environments change, and opportunity costs evolve. Capital is not preserved by accounting — only by continued productive allocation.

Depreciation is physical, not financial.


---

## How They Tie Together

Energy constrains what can be done

Capital constrains how fast capacity can grow

Time constrains all outcomes

Allocation is the act that connects them


Neither system dominates the other.
Neither makes promises.
Both are governed by the same logic:

Allocate what you have, under real constraints, and accept the outcome.
