## Physical Allocation Node Demonstration 

The D-NODE is a small, real-world energy system designed to make allocation visible, measurable, and unavoidable.

It is not a simulation. It is a working solar-powered microgrid that receives energy, stores some of it, consumes some of it, and transforms any remaining surplus.

Every watt that enters the system must be allocated in time. Nothing is assumed. Nothing is hidden. 

The purpose of the node is to demonstrate, in physical hardware, the core idea of Allocation Economics: economic outcomes are the result of allocation decisions made under real constraints.

The node models a rural microgrid using three prioritized load classes: 

- **Domestic** (reliability-critical) Domestic loads represent non-negotiable human needs that must always be served.

- **Industrial** (productive and schedulable) Industrial loads represent useful work that can be scheduled to align with energy availability.

- **Load Balancing** a fully flexible surplus sink that represents optional transformation. A place for energy that would otherwise be curtailed or wasted, without creating stress elsewhere in the system. 

These loads are intentionally different in character.

Together, these layers show how variable solar generation can be balanced through design rather than overbuilding storage or curtailing production.

The D-NODE does not attempt to optimize for profit, efficiency, or ideological goals. 

Its purpose is clarity. By exposing energy flows, time dependence, and priority decisions in a single, inspectable system, the node makes visible what is normally abstracted away by large grids and markets.

What happens at this scale is not a special case — it is the same allocation problem faced by households, farms, factories, and entire economies. 

The D-NODE simply makes the choices explicit.
