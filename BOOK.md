## Introduction - A World of Choices

Imagine a world where sunlight falls freely on rooftops, batteries hum quietly in homes, and machines wait patiently for instructions.

Imagine a world where every action, every choice, every effort counts, because energy, time, and resources are real and limited.

This book is a story about that world.

**Why This Book Exists**

People have long thought economics is complicated, mysterious, or only for adults.
We’ve been told that money controls everything, that markets are magical, and that scarcity is a problem we can’t touch.

This is not true.
At its heart, economics is about one simple thing: allocation.

Who decides?
What gets used?
When and where?
How much goes to this task or that?

Every choice shapes the world around us.

**A Story for Everyone**

This book is for children, students, parents, and curious grown-ups.
It explains how energy flows, how machines work, how communities survive, and how decisions ripple outward.

It tells a story that is simple enough to imagine, yet powerful enough to influence real-world action.

You will meet villages, solar panels, batteries, mills, and even Bitcoin miners.

But behind the story is a simple principle: humans allocate resources, the system obeys physics and opportunity matters.

**What You Will Learn**

How energy and time form the foundation of all activity

Why machines are tools, not masters

How surplus can be measured, stored, and shared

How to think like an Allocator - at home, at work, and in the wider world

How energy, capital, and human action combine to create resilient communities


By the end, you will see that allocation is not abstract. It is everyday, everywhere, and in your hands.

**How to Read This Book**

Read it like a story. Imagine the villages, the water, the sun, and the land.

Notice the lessons hidden in the actions of villagers and machines.

Reflect on your own choices, on how you allocate your time, energy, and attention.

Remember - every decision is part of a larger loop of cause and effect.



---

**The Invitation**

This is not just a book.

It is a guide to becoming an Allocator - someone who sees resources clearly, makes conscious choices, and measures the impact of each action.

The villages are waiting.

The sun is shining.

The mills are ready.

All that is missing is you.
