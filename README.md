# ALLOCATE

## Overview

ALLOCATE is an open research and engineering project exploring how economic systems behave when allocation is constrained by physical reality rather than monetary abstraction.

The project treats energy, time, and irreversible work as first-class economic primitives. It focuses on measurement before control and allocation before optimization, using simple hardware, transparent data, and minimal interfaces to make economic activity observable and auditable.

ALLOCATE is not a currency, a protocol, or a market. It is a framework for understanding and designing systems where economic claims cannot exceed physical constraints.

## Motivation

Modern economic systems are highly effective at coordination, but fragile at their foundations. Monetary instruments routinely create claims on future production without binding those claims to measurable, irreversible inputs. This disconnect obscures cost, distorts signals, and shifts economic debate from reality to policy.

At the same time, renewable energy systems - solar in particular - have become locally measurable, widely accessible, and physically transparent. We now possess the tools to observe production constraints directly, in real time, using globally agreed units.

ALLOCATE is motivated by a simple question:

What would economic coordination look like if allocation decisions were visibly constrained by physics instead of abstract accounting?

## Core Idea

All economic activity is an allocation problem.

Scarce inputs—energy, time, materials, attention—must be assigned among competing uses. Whether explicit or implicit, every decision allocates something now, later, or never.

ALLOCATE makes this process explicit.

By grounding economic activity in measurable inputs and enforcing irreversibility at the interface level, the system replaces hidden abstraction with observable trade-offs. Allocation decisions are expressed intentionally, constrained by reality, and recorded as they unfold in time.

The result is not a new market or ideology, but a clearer view of what is already happening.

## First Principles

ALLOCATE rests on a small set of physical truths that apply regardless of culture, policy, or preference:

**Energy is conserved**

**Energy cannot be created - only converted or dissipated**

**Useful energy degrades with use, storage, and time**

**Time is irreversible**

Decisions move forward; past allocations cannot be undone without additional cost. Measurement precedes control. You cannot allocate what you have not measured.

These principles are not economic opinions. They are properties of the physical world.

The axioms that follow translate these truths into enforceable constraints for economic systems.

## The Five Core Axioms of Allocation Economics

### Axiom 1 — Physical Constraint

All economic activity is constrained by irreversible physical inputs.

Production requires inputs—energy, time, materials, or attention—that cannot be recovered without additional expenditure. Economic scarcity originates in physical reality, not policy, preference, or accounting.

### Axiom 2 — One-Way Entry

Inputs enter the economic system as irreversible inflows.

Energy, time, and materials arrive once. They may be converted, stored imperfectly, or dissipated, but they cannot be cyclically reintroduced without further cost. There is no perpetual motion in economics.

### Axiom 3 — Allocation

Scarce inputs must be allocated among competing uses.

Every unit of input is assigned—explicitly or implicitly—to immediate use, delayed use, transformation, or loss. Non-allocation is itself an allocation decision.

### Axiom 4 — Time Irreversibility

Allocation decisions are time-bound and irreversible.

Once an input is allocated, alternative possibilities collapse. Reversing an allocation requires additional inputs and introduces loss. Economic history advances forward only.

### Axiom 5 — Physical Accounting

Valid economic claims must be consistent with physical constraints.

Records of value, ownership, or exchange cannot exceed the limits imposed by irreversible inputs and time. Monetary systems that permit claims detached from these constraints introduce distortion, instability, and false signals.

## What ALLOCATE is

ALLOCATE is a framework for observing and expressing allocation decisions under physical constraints.

It provides a:
- vocabulary for describing economic activity in terms of energy, time, and irreversible work
- measurement-first approach where inputs and limits are visible before decisions are made
- interfaces that enforce irreversibility and constraint at the point of allocation
- reference model for building hardware, software, and economic experiments that cannot violate physics

ALLOCATE treats allocation as a continuous process rather than a one-time choice. It makes explicit what is normally implicit: that scarcity exists, trade-offs are unavoidable, and time advances regardless of intention.

## What ALLOCATE is not

ALLOCATE is not a:
- currency, token, or payment network
- replacement for markets, prices, or voluntary exchange
- claim that energy determines value or utility
- system that guarantees fairness, equality, or optimal outcomes
- solution to political or social disagreement

ALLOCATE does not prescribe what should be produced, consumed, or valued. 
It does not rank human needs or define priorities. It only constrains what can be claimed, allocated, or recorded to what is physically possible.

If an implementation allows economic claims to exceed measurable inputs or time, it is not ALLOCATE.

## Allocation Economics

Allocation Economics is the study of how economic coordination emerges when allocation decisions are made explicit and constrained by irreversible inputs.

In this model, production is not the starting point. Allocation is. Energy, time, and materials enter the system as one-way inflows. They must be assigned among immediate use, delayed use, transformation, or loss. Once assigned, alternative possibilities collapse.

Value is not derived from energy itself, but from human preference acting within these constraints. Prices, exchange, and markets remain mechanisms for coordinating subjective value, but they operate downstream of physically honest cost.

Allocation Economics does not eliminate abstraction; it limits it. Accounting systems may summarize, store, or transfer claims, but they cannot exceed the irreversible work already performed.

The purpose of Allocation Economics is not to optimize outcomes, but to make trade-offs visible, auditable, and unavoidable.
