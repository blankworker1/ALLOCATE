# ALLOCATE

## Overview

ALLOCATE is an open research and engineering project exploring how economic systems behave when allocation is constrained by physical reality rather than monetary abstraction.

The project treats energy, time, and irreversible work as first-class economic primitives. It focuses on measurement before control and allocation before optimization, using simple hardware, transparent data, and minimal interfaces to make economic activity observable and auditable.

ALLOCATE is not a currency, a protocol, or a market. It is a framework for understanding and designing systems where economic claims cannot exceed physical constraints.

## Motivation

Modern economic systems are highly effective at coordination, but fragile at their foundations. Monetary instruments routinely create claims on future production without binding those claims to measurable, irreversible inputs. This disconnect obscures cost, distorts signals, and shifts economic debate from reality to policy.

At the same time, renewable energy systems - solar in particular - have become locally measurable, widely accessible, and physically transparent. We now possess the tools to observe production constraints directly, in real time, using globally agreed units.

ALLOCATE is motivated by a simple question:

```
What would economic coordination look like if allocation decisions were visibly constrained by physics instead of abstract accounting?
```

## Core Idea

All economic activity is an allocation problem.

Scarce inputs—energy, time, materials, attention—must be assigned among competing uses. Whether explicit or implicit, every decision allocates something now, later, or never.

ALLOCATE makes this process explicit.

By grounding economic activity in measurable inputs and enforcing irreversibility at the interface level, the system replaces hidden abstraction with observable trade-offs. Allocation decisions are expressed intentionally, constrained by reality, and recorded as they unfold in time.

The result is not a new market or ideology, but a clearer view of what is already happening.

## First Principles

ALLOCATE rests on a small set of physical truths that apply regardless of culture, policy, or preference:

**Energy is conserved**

**Energy cannot be created - only converted or dissipated**

**Useful energy degrades with use, storage, and time**

**Time is irreversible**

Decisions move forward; past allocations cannot be undone without additional cost. Measurement precedes control. You cannot allocate what you have not measured.

These principles are not economic opinions. They are properties of the physical world.

The axioms that follow translate these truths into enforceable constraints for economic systems.

## The Five Core Axioms of Allocation Economics

### Axiom 1 — Physical Constraint

All economic activity is constrained by irreversible physical inputs.

Production requires inputs—energy, time, materials, or attention—that cannot be recovered without additional expenditure. Economic scarcity originates in physical reality, not policy, preference, or accounting.

### Axiom 2 — One-Way Entry

Inputs enter the economic system as irreversible inflows.

Energy, time, and materials arrive once. They may be converted, stored imperfectly, or dissipated, but they cannot be cyclically reintroduced without further cost. There is no perpetual motion in economics.

### Axiom 3 — Allocation

Scarce inputs must be allocated among competing uses.

Every unit of input is assigned—explicitly or implicitly—to immediate use, delayed use, transformation, or loss. Non-allocation is itself an allocation decision.

### Axiom 4 — Time Irreversibility

Allocation decisions are time-bound and irreversible.

Once an input is allocated, alternative possibilities collapse. Reversing an allocation requires additional inputs and introduces loss. Economic history advances forward only.

### Axiom 5 — Physical Accounting

Valid economic claims must be consistent with physical constraints.

Records of value, ownership, or exchange cannot exceed the limits imposed by irreversible inputs and time. Monetary systems that permit claims detached from these constraints introduce distortion, instability, and false signals.

## What ALLOCATE is

ALLOCATE is a framework for observing and expressing allocation decisions under physical constraints.

It provides a:
- vocabulary for describing economic activity in terms of energy, time, and irreversible work
- measurement-first approach where inputs and limits are visible before decisions are made
- interfaces that enforce irreversibility and constraint at the point of allocation
- reference model for building hardware, software, and economic experiments that cannot violate physics

ALLOCATE treats allocation as a continuous process rather than a one-time choice. It makes explicit what is normally implicit: that scarcity exists, trade-offs are unavoidable, and time advances regardless of intention.

## What ALLOCATE is not

ALLOCATE is not a:
- currency, token, or payment network
- replacement for markets, prices, or voluntary exchange
- claim that energy determines value or utility
- system that guarantees fairness, equality, or optimal outcomes
- solution to political or social disagreement

ALLOCATE does not prescribe what should be produced, consumed, or valued. 
It does not rank human needs or define priorities. It only constrains what can be claimed, allocated, or recorded to what is physically possible.

If an implementation allows economic claims to exceed measurable inputs or time, it is not ALLOCATE.

## Allocation Economics

Allocation Economics is the study of how economic coordination emerges when allocation decisions are made explicit and constrained by irreversible inputs.

In this model, production is not the starting point. Allocation is. Energy, time, and materials enter the system as one-way inflows. They must be assigned among immediate use, delayed use, transformation, or loss. Once assigned, alternative possibilities collapse.

Value is not derived from energy itself, but from human preference acting within these constraints. Prices, exchange, and markets remain mechanisms for coordinating subjective value, but they operate downstream of physically honest cost.

Allocation Economics does not eliminate abstraction; it limits it. Accounting systems may summarize, store, or transfer claims, but they cannot exceed the irreversible work already performed.

The purpose of Allocation Economics is not to optimize outcomes, but to make trade-offs visible, auditable, and unavoidable.

## Measurement and Constraints

Allocation requires measurement.

ALLOCATE treats measurement as a prerequisite for economic action, not a byproduct of accounting. Only quantities that can be observed, measured, or reliably derived may be allocated or claimed.

Measurements are expressed in globally agreed physical units:
- Energy (watts, watt-hours, joules)
- Time (seconds)
- Power (energy per unit time)
- Stored capacity (bounded, lossy)
- Irreversible work (observable through transformation)

Measurement is imperfect. Sensors fail. Storage degrades. Losses occur. These limitations are not errors in the model; they are part of the constraint set. Uncertainty, decay, and latency introduce time preference and natural friction into allocation decisions.

Constraints arise from:
- Finite energy inflows
- Bounded storage capacity and efficiency
- Maximum conversion rates
- Irreversible time progression

ALLOCATE does not attempt to smooth, average, or abstract away these constraints. They are surfaced directly. If an allocation cannot be satisfied given current measurements and limits, it is rejected or deferred.
Measurement does not determine value. It defines feasibility.

## The Allocation Loop

The Allocation Loop describes the continuous process by which economic activity unfolds under constraint.
- **Measure**
Current state is observed: available energy, stored capacity, active loads, time position.
- **Constrain**
Physical limits are applied: inflow bounds, storage limits, rate caps, and time progression.
- **Allocate**
Inputs are assigned among competing uses for a discrete time interval. Allocation may be manual, automated, or assisted, but it must conform to constraints.
- **Execute**
Allocation decisions are enacted. Energy is consumed, stored, transformed, or dissipated.
- **Record**
Outcomes are observed and logged. Allocations become history. Unused inputs are lost.
- **Advance Time**
The system moves forward. Past allocations cannot be revised.

This loop repeats continuously. There is no reset, rewind, or equilibrium state. Stability, when it occurs, is temporary and contingent.

The purpose of the Allocation Loop is not optimization, but honesty. It ensures that economic activity progresses in a way that is observable, constrained, and accountable to reality.

## System Model

ALLOCATE models an economic system as a set of autonomous nodes operating under shared physical measurement standards.

Each node represents a single geographic location where energy is harvested, stored, consumed, or transformed. Nodes do not exchange energy. They coordinate, when necessary, through transferable records of irreversible work.

### Node Structure

Each node consists of four functional domains:
- **Harvest**
Energy entering the node from external sources. Examples include solar, wind, or other measurable inflows.
- **Store**
Temporary retention of energy or materials. Storage is bounded, lossy, and time-dependent.
- **Consume**
Direct use of energy or materials to sustain life, maintain infrastructure, or perform productive activity.
- **Transform**
Conversion of energy into durable, transferable records of work or into materially transformed outputs.

These domains are distinct but interdependent. All operate under physical limits and time progression.

### Flow Characteristics

Inputs enter only through Harvest

Outputs leave only through Consume or Transform

Store mediates between inflow and use but does not eliminate loss

No domain is cyclically self-sustaining

There is no assumption of balance, equilibrium, or continuity of supply.

### Allocation Domain

Allocation governs how harvested and stored inputs are assigned across domains for each discrete time interval.

Allocation decisions:
- Are constrained by measurement and capacity
- Apply only to future time intervals
- Become irreversible once executed
- Collapse alternative possibilities
Allocation does not imply optimization. It expresses intent within constraint.

### Node Autonomy

Each node operates independently:
- Local measurement
- Local constraints
- Local allocation decisions
Nodes require no central authority to function. Survival and production are possible without external coordination.

### Coordination Across Nodes

When coordination across space or time is required, nodes may exchange records representing irreversible work already performed.
These records:
- Do not transmit energy
- Do not guarantee future production
- Do not bypass local constraints
They function solely as a coordination and accounting mechanism.

### Failure and Constraint Propagation

If any domain reaches its limit:
- Excess input is curtailed or dissipated
- Allocation options are reduced
- No compensatory abstraction is introduced
- Constraint propagation is visible and immediate.

### System Properties

The system exhibits:
- Physical honesty
- Local autonomy
- Global measurability
- Linear scalability
There is no requirement for trust beyond measurement. The model does not assume rational behavior, efficiency, or fairness. It only enforces consistency with physical reality.

### Summary

The system model describes an economy as a continuous process of constrained allocation occurring across autonomous nodes.
Energy flows in. Time advances. Decisions are made. History accumulates.
Nothing more is assumed.

## Dashboard and Interface Philosophy

The dashboard is not a control panel in the traditional sense. It is an instrument.An integral part of the system. Its purpose is to make constraints visible, allocation explicit, and irreversibility legible over time.

The interface does not simulate the system. It is the system’s public surface.

### Design Principles

1. Measurement First, Control Second
   
Every visible element corresponds to a measurable physical quantity or a declared allocation decision.

No value is displayed unless it can be measured directly by sensors, or derived deterministically from measured inputs.

There are no abstract indicators, scores, or inferred “health” metrics.

2. Allocation Is the Central Act
   
The interface exists to answer one question:

Where is the next unit of input going?

Allocation is always forward-looking. The UI never edits the past.

Manual control is expressed only as allocation targets, allocation limits and allocation timing. If an allocation cannot be executed due to constraint, it is rejected visibly.

3. Constraint Visibility Over Optimization
   
The dashboard does not attempt to optimize outcomes.

Instead, it exposes capacity limits, saturation points, loss and decay and curtailment events. Constraint is not an error state — it is normal operation.

4. No Illusion of Perpetual Motion

The interface avoids circular metaphors that imply self-sustaining loops.
Flows are directional. Time progresses. States change irreversibly.
The absence of arrows is intentional.

### Interface States

**Default State** - View: Displays current node state. No controls visible.
The word ALLOCATE appears in a white rectangular background.
This is the system at rest.

**Active State** - Configured: Allocation parameters are defined.
The word ALLOCATE appears in a green rectangular background.
Indicates all domains are within measurable and executable bounds.
Green means consistent with physics, not “good”.

**Constraint State** - Out of Parameter: one or more domains exceed capacity or violate timing constraints.
The word ALLOCATE background turns red and letters pulse slowly to indicate unresolved tension.
Red means allocation intent cannot be satisfied.

### Time as the Primary Axis

Time is represented as a rotating ring:
24 hours divided into 10-minute intervals. Each interval is allocatable.
Current time is marked by a triangle at the top of the ring.
Allocation applies only to future segments.
Once time passes, the segment becomes immutable history.
The rest of the dashboard exists inside this ring.

### Domain Representation

The four domains — Harvest, Store, Consume, Transform — appear as distinct regions with:

Current capacity

Current utilization

Allocated share (%)

Measured parameters (SI units only)

No totals are hidden. No averages are smoothed.

### Minimal Interaction Modes

Bottom task bar:
- **V** View (read-only)
- **A** Allocate (manual allocation input)
- **S** Settings (system parameters)

Allocation sliders snap to discrete 10-minute intervals and are bounded by physical limits.

### What the UI Refuses to Do

Predict prices

Forecast demand

Rank outcomes

Conceal loss

Abstract away time

The UI is intentionally austere.

If the user feels discomfort, it is because constraint is visible.
