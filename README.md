# ALLOCATE

ALLOCATE is an open research and engineering project exploring how economic systems change when allocation is constrained by physics instead of policy.
The project treats energy, time, and irreversible work as first-class economic primitives. Measurement precedes control. Allocation replaces abstraction.
