# ALLOCATE

ALLOCATE is an open research and engineering project exploring how economic systems change when allocation is constrained by physics instead of policy.
The project treats energy, time, and irreversible work as first-class economic primitives. Measurement precedes control. Allocation replaces abstraction.

## The Five Core Axioms of Allocation Economics

### Axiom 1 — Physical Constraint

All economic activity is constrained by irreversible physical inputs.

Production requires inputs—energy, time, materials, or attention—that cannot be recovered without additional expenditure. Economic scarcity originates in physical reality, not policy, preference, or accounting.

### Axiom 2 — One-Way Entry

Inputs enter the economic system as irreversible inflows.

Energy, time, and materials arrive once. They may be converted, stored imperfectly, or dissipated, but they cannot be cyclically reintroduced without further cost. There is no perpetual motion in economics.

### Axiom 3 — Allocation

Scarce inputs must be allocated among competing uses.

Every unit of input is assigned—explicitly or implicitly—to immediate use, delayed use, transformation, or loss. Non-allocation is itself an allocation decision.

### Axiom 4 — Time Irreversibility

Allocation decisions are time-bound and irreversible.

Once an input is allocated, alternative possibilities collapse. Reversing an allocation requires additional inputs and introduces loss. Economic history advances forward only.

### Axiom 5 — Physical Accounting

Valid economic claims must be consistent with physical constraints.

Records of value, ownership, or exchange cannot exceed the limits imposed by irreversible inputs and time. Monetary systems that permit claims detached from these constraints introduce distortion, instability, and false signals.
